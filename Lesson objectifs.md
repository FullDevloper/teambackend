# Let's add few middlwares

Let's setup cross-env and add some middlwares (Functionality, Security and Speed).

## Objectifs

- Run scripts that set and use environment variables across platforms with cross-env.

- Adding Morgan middleware as an HTTP request logger middleware for node js.

- Add Helmet middleware, Helmet helps you secure your Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.

- Adding Express json and urlencoded middleware to parse json request from body and url.

- Adding Express-mongo-sanitize middleware which sanitizes user-supplied data to prevent MongoDB Operator Injection.

- Adding Cookie-parser middleware to parse Cookie header and populate req.cookies with an object keyed by the cookie names.

- Adding Compression middleware to compress response bodies for all request that traverse through the middleware.

- Adding Express-fileupload middleware to make uploaded files accessible from req.files.

- Adding cors middleware to protect and restrict access to the server.
